        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a quick and easy tiramisu recipe that a good friend's mother was kind enough to share with me. Don't tell her I'm sharing it here!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups mascarpone cheese</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>2 (3 ounce) packages of ladyfingers (approximately 24 ladyfingers total)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup Kahlua (or coffee / substitution of your choice)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Toppings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) square semisweet chocolate (shaved)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>Before you begin, chill the mixing bowl you'll be whipping the cream in.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring water to a boil in the bottom pot of a double boiler. Keep the top pot off of the boiler for now.</li>
            <li>Combine egg yolks and sugar in the top pot of the double boiler.</li>
            <li>Once combined, add top pot with egg and sugar mixture to the bottom pot and reduce heat to low.</li>
            <li>Stirring constantly, cook the mixture for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes, remove the mixture from the heat and whip in the yolks until the mixture is thick.</li>
            <li>Add the mascarpone cheese to the whipped yolks and beat until combined.</li>
            <li>Pull your chilled bowl out of the refrigerator and whip the cream until stiff peaks are formed.</li>
            <li>Gently fold the whipped cream into the mixture and set aside.</li>
            <li>Line bottom and sides of your serving dish with lady fingers.</li>
            <li>Brush the lady fingers in Kahlua or your substition.</li>
            <li>Spoon half of the cream filling over the lady fingers.</li>
            <li>Now repeat adding lady fingers, brushing with Kahlua, and covering with filling until you run out of lady fingers or reach the top of your dish.</li>
            <li>Cover the top layer of filling with cocoa and chocolate shavings.</li>
            <li>Now cover your tiramisu and refrigerate for several hours. Preferably, refrigerate overnight.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>That's it! Now you're ready to serve your homemade tiramisu.</p>
