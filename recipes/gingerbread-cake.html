        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a gingerbread cake recipe from the New York Times that I have been making every holiday season for a few years now.
            It has become a classic in my family and we always look forward to it during Christmas time. The recipe is a little involved,
            but altogether can be done in a few hours. It's been a hard recipe to mess up, even when it feels like it won't turn out.

        <p>Here's the link to the orignal recipe on NY Times:

            <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>

            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons finely grated fresh ginger (a 2-ounce piece, peeled)</li>
            <li>Grated zest of 2 lemons</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grapeseed oil</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>3/4 cup stout beer</li>
            <li>3/4 cup molasses</li>
            <li>1/3 cup brewed coffee</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 cup confectioner's surgar, sifted</li>
            <li>2 to 4 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees.</li>
            <li>Grease an 8-inch springform cake pan and line bottom with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk flour, cocoa, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and Â½ teaspoon salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine brown sugar, turbinado, ginger, zest of 1 lemon and oil. Beat in egg.</li>
            <li>Place beer, molasses and coffee in a deep pot, at least 3 quarts. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and stir in baking soda. Mixture will bubble up. Allow to cool 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour mixture alternately with beer mixture into brown sugar mixture, in 3 shifts.</li>
            <li>Pour batter in pan and bake 40 minutes without opening oven.</li>
            <li>Give pan a 180-degree turn and bake another 15 minutes, until cake is springy and a tester comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Cool on a rack. When cool, remove sides of pan, invert briefly to remove bottom of pan and paper and set upright on a plate.</li>
            <li>Place confectioner's sugar in a bowl, whisk in remaining zest and salt, then lemon juice (add up to 2 additional tablespoons to moisten if necessary).</li>
            <li>Spread over top of cake, allowing glaze to drip down the sides.</li>
        </ol>
